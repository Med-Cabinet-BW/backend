"Afpak","Earthy","Hybrid","Relaxed","Dizzy","Depression",4.2,"Afpak, named for its direct Afghani and Pakistani landrace heritage, is a beautiful indica-dominant hybrid with light green and deep bluish purple leaves. The taste and aroma are floral with a touch of lemon, making the inhale light and smooth. Its effects start in the stomach by activating the appetite. There is also a potent relaxation that starts in the head and face, and gradually sinks down into the body. Enjoy this strain if youâ€™re suffering from stress, mild physical discomfort, or having difficulty eating."
